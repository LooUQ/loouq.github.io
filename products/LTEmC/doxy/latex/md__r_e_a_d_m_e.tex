Loo\+UQ Circuit River LTEm1 modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint.

The Loo\+UQ LTEm1c driver supports the Loo\+UQ Circuit River LTEm1 LTE modem. The LTEm1 is designed to allow for cost-\/effective cellular communications in embedded systems by supporting LTE CAT-\/\+M1 and LTE CAT-\/\+NB1 (NB-\/\+IOT) communications. The LTEm1 is certified for use on the Verizon network. Tested on all major US networks and fully compatible with Hologram SIMs.

All of the core (blue) subsystems are functional. Extension subsystems (copper, with wide-\/borders) are optional and can be built into the application, or omitted to reduced code size. Grey boxes indicate future feature areas.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{Latest Release\+: v2.\+2}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md17}

{\itshape First off, thanks for taking a look at the Loo\+UQ LTEm1 hardware and LTEmC software!}

The best way to get started understanding LTEmC and considering it for your projects {\itshape today} is to look at the tests folder in the repository. This collection of test/examples will continue to grow in future releases and new use cases are demonstrated. The tests folder contains a series of progressive LTEm1c tests. Starting with simple platform I/O verification through to application protocol support (sockets, MQTT, HTTP), each test builds upon a succesful previous level test. While called {\bfseries{tests}}, these projects they serve as {\bfseries{examples of how to do specific use cases}}. These are your best source for scaffold code to start your LTEm project.

{\bfseries{Each test shows the process for initializing, starting services, and a loop exercising the functionality of the subsystem under test.}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsubsection{LTEm\+C Subsystems}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md20}

{\itshape atcmd\+\_\+}   &Handles invoking AT commands to the modem\textquotesingle{}s module and handling response parsing. Supports variable command timeouts, thread safety and completion determination. Results are presented in a simple STRUCT with a HTTP type status code, along with the detail string response    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mdminfo\+\_\+}   &Provides several common service functions for understanding the state of the modem and the network connection    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape gnss\+\_\+}   &The LTEm1 has a multi-\/constellation GNSS receiver (aka GPS is the US). The GNSS module provides support for accessing this functionality, like knowing exactly where your device is.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape geo\+\_\+}   &The LTEm1 supports the creation of geo-\/fence outlines and monitoring of device positioning relative to the geo-\/fence boundary. Note\+: geo\+\_\+ requires the gnss\+\_\+ module be built into your project to use these functions.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape sockets\+\_\+}   &This is the typical POSIX style sockets layer. Support if TCP/\+UDP/\+SSL clients are there. {\itshape Note\+:} server mode is not currently planned, all US networks I have worked with do not support incoming connections for cellular without add-\/on services like VPNs or other network constructs. I recommend alternatives to attempting direct connection to your device over cellular.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mqtt\+\_\+}   &Support for MQTT client functionality is built here. Attach, connect, subscribe, unsubscribe and publish all are supported. Limited testing so far on QOS levels and advance features like clean and will. The MQTT module supports message properties appended to the topic and has a property parser available.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape http\+\_\+}   &Support for HTTP client functionality is found here. Perform HTTP GET or POST actions with standard or custom request headers.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape iop\+\_\+}   &Generally you won\textquotesingle{}t directly interact with the iop\+\_\+ subsystem. It performs the buffer management to/from hardware. It interfaces with the action\+\_\+, sockets\+\_\+, and mqtt\+\_\+ subsystems to perform the necessary transfers.   \\\cline{1-2}
