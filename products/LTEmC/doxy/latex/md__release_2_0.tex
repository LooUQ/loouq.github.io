Release 2.\+0

Loo\+UQ is ready for tomorrow with the release of LTEmC version 2. Version 2 started in early June as version 1.\+1, intending to add HTTP support and the ability to dynamically load/unload protocols. To accomplish these goals it became apparent these objectives, there were some structural changes required. As these started being tackled, it took on a life of its own and numerous previously indentified issues got folded in to create the LTEmC that would stand up to the demands of the next several years; including additional protocols, support for 2 new modem models planned for the next 6 months, and new hardware features.

The primary goal of the version 2.\+0 release is to enable the above future roadmap with little or no change to the exposed public API. Loo\+UQ has accomplished this by reversing several dependencies and giving the application ownership of the data buffers and encapsulation of the protocol controls (sockets, MQTT, HTTP, etc.).

Previous versions of LTEmC allocated all buffers and protocol controls (structs). This resulted in memory bload, as the worse-\/case assumtions lead to larger buffers and multiple storage locations for protocol controls. This approach has been replaced with application defined (owned) data receive buffers and protocol controls.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item At a minimum, to implement a protocol, your application will need to create a receive buffer (rx\+Buffer) and a protocol control. LTEmC only references these via pointers.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item These can be local variables, if short lived.
\item They can be dynamic and created by malloc().
\item Or, they can be global variables.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Protocol instances can share a rx\+Buffer. {\itshape Theoretically it is possible for different protocols to share a buffer but this has not been tested.}
\item Each protocol has an \+\_\+init\+Control() function to initialize your protocol instance control.
\item There are 6 protocol \char`\"{}slots\char`\"{} defined in an enum as data\+Context\+\_\+0 through data\+Context\+\_\+5 the a protocol instance can be assigned to.
\item In version 2.\+1, with support added for the BGx file system, there is a special slot stream\+Peer\+\_\+6.
\item Use of the \mbox{\hyperlink{ltemc_8c_a5b79bd67186c40d469be1bcc5dcd412b}{ltem\+\_\+do\+Work()}} function in the application\textquotesingle{}s main loop() is only required if your application utilizes protocols with asynchronous receive events. Sockets and MQTT both have asynchronous receive behavior; HTTP(\+S) receives are fully synchronous with page funtions.

 To fully understand how to setup each of the currently supported protocols (Sockets, MQTT, and HTTP), review the associated \char`\"{}test\char`\"{} INO file. Each of these have numerous comments on the protocol\textquotesingle{}s setup and can serve as a blueprint for your application if running under the Arduino framework.
