Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a example file demonstrating host application access to the GNSS location feature of the LTEm modem. With an attached antenna, the LTEm device can receive GNSS signals and provide the modem;s location to the host application.

The LTEm modems also support geo-\/fencing. The geo-\/fencing feature is not demonstrated in this example.
