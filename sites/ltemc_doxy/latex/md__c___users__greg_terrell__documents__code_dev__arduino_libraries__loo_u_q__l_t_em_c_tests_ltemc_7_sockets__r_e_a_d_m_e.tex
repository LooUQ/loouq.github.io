Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a example file demonstrating host application use of sockets (UDP/\+TCP/\+SSL/\+TLS) communications to a remote host/server. Sockets can be used to create a communications path between the LTEm device and a remote host where the application is capable of encoding/decoding a proprietary data scheme. Most users would be more likely to use higher level protocols such as HTTP or MQTT for remote host communication.
