Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a test/example file for the LTEmC driver to validate access to the BGx module on the Loo\+UQ LTEmX modem. The test initializes modem I/O at a basic level so that information can be sent to the BGx module over SPI and its response can be read.
