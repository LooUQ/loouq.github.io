The LTEm3F has 6 GPIO pins and 2 ADC pins for general purpose I/O expansion.

This is a example file demonstrating host application access to the modem\textquotesingle{}s GPIO capabilities. The example assumes that a \char`\"{}wrap cable\char`\"{} has been installed allowing various pins to be cross-\/connected.

Details for the cable forthcoming with the release of the CR-\/\+LTEM3F device in summer 2023.
