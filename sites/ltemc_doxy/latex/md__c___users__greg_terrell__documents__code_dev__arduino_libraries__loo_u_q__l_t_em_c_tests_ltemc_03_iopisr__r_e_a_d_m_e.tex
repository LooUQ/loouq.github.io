Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a test/example file for the LTEmC driver to validate access to the LTEm modem using interrupts and full-\/speed I/O. This test is of primary interest for those users porting LTEmC to a new framework/platform. It specifically tests the ISR (interrupt service routine) to ensure UART buffers are serviced in a timely manner.
