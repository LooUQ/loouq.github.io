Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a test/example file for the LTEmC driver to validate command processing and data marshalling. The ATCMD module supervises communication between the BGx and the application level functionality in LTEmC (modem information, network management, protocols, file system, etc.).

The ATCMD module is the primary extension interface for new features/subsystems to utilize when performing actions on the LTEm device.
