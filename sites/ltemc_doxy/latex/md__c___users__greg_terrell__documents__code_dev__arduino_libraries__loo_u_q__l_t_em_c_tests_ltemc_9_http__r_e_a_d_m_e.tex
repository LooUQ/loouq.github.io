Circuit\+River $\vert$ LTEmC modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint

This is a example file demonstrating host application use of HTTP protocol for device/server communications. HTTP GET and POST are supported allowing for a simple transactional style communications pattern. With HTTP the remote device (LTEm equipped device) controls the tempo of communications. Host systems can still send configuration or request information to the remote, but only at the initiation of the remote. This type of communications is best suited for {\bfseries{sensor}} type IoT applications where the server needs to perform actions on the remote device in near realtime.
