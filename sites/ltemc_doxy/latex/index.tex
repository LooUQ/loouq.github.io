L\+T\+Em1 modem driver implemented in C for portability and a small footprint.

The Loo\+UQ L\+T\+EmC driver supports the Loo\+UQ Circuit River L\+T\+Em1 L\+TE modem. The L\+T\+Em1 is designed to allow for cost-\/effective cellular communications in embedded systems by supporting L\+TE C\+A\+T-\/\+M1 and L\+TE C\+A\+T-\/\+N\+B1 (N\+B-\/\+I\+OT) communications. The L\+T\+Em1 is certified for use on the Verizon network. It is also fully tested and supported using Hologram S\+I\+Ms and several US carriers.

{\bfseries{First off, thanks for taking a look at the L\+T\+Em1 hardware and L\+T\+EmC software!}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{Getting Started}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
The best way to get started understanding L\+T\+EmC and considering it for your projects {\itshape today} is to look at the tests folder in the repository. This collection of test/examples will continue to grow in future releases and new use cases are demonstrated. The tests folder contains a series of progressive L\+T\+Em1c tests. Starting with simple platform I/O verification through to application protocol support (sockets, M\+Q\+TT, H\+T\+TP), each test builds upon a succesful previous level test. While called {\bfseries{tests}}, these projects they serve as {\bfseries{examples of how to do specific use cases}}. These are your best source for scaffold code to start your L\+T\+Em project.

{\bfseries{Each test shows the process for initializing, starting services, and a loop exercising the functionality of the subsystem under test.}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysubsubsection{L\+T\+Em\+C Subsystems}\label{index_autotoc_md3}

{\itshape atcmd\+\_\+}  &Handles invoking AT commands to the modem\textquotesingle{}s module and handling response parsing. Supports variable command timeouts, thread safety and completion determination. Results are presented in a simple S\+T\+R\+U\+CT with a H\+T\+TP type status code, along with the detail string response   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mdminfo\+\_\+}  &Provides several common service functions for understanding the state of the modem and the network connection   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape gnss\+\_\+}  &The L\+T\+Em1 has a multi-\/constellation G\+N\+SS receiver (aka G\+PS is the US). The G\+N\+SS module provides support for accessing this functionality, like knowing exactly where your device is.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape geo\+\_\+}  &The L\+T\+Em1 supports the creation of geo-\/fence outlines and monitoring of device positioning relative to the geo-\/fence boundary. Note\+: geo\+\_\+ requires the gnss\+\_\+ module be built into your project to use these functions.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape sockets\+\_\+}  &This is the typical P\+O\+S\+IX style sockets layer. Support if T\+C\+P/\+U\+D\+P/\+S\+SL clients are there. {\itshape Note\+:} server mode is not currently planned, all US networks I have worked with do not support incoming connections for cellular without add-\/on services like V\+P\+Ns or other network constructs. I recommend alternatives to attempting direct connection to your device over cellular.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mqtt\+\_\+}  &Support for M\+Q\+TT client functionality is built here. Attach, connect, subscribe, unsubscribe and publish all are supported. Limited testing so far on Q\+OS levels and advance features like clean and will. The M\+Q\+TT module supports message properties appended to the topic and has a property parser available.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape http\+\_\+}  &Support for H\+T\+TP client functionality is found here. Perform H\+T\+TP G\+ET or P\+O\+ST actions with standard or custom request headers.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape iop\+\_\+}  &Generally you won\textquotesingle{}t directly interact with the iop\+\_\+ subsystem. It performs the buffer management to/from hardware. It interfaces with the action\+\_\+, sockets\+\_\+, and mqtt\+\_\+ subsystems to perform the necessary transfers.   \\\cline{1-2}

All of the core (blue) subsystems are functional. Extension subsystems (copper, with wide-\/borders) are optional and can be built into the application, or omitted to reduced code size. Grey boxes indicate future feature areas.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Future Directions}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
