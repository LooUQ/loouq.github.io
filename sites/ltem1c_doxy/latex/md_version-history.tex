Overhaul of the I\+OP buffering system.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Simplified receive buffer management and eliminated copies from receive pipeline
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Small copy $<$60 chars remains (required) for M\+Q\+TT receives
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Reduce code in I\+SR path, push processing to do\+Work() background path
\item Finishing M\+Q\+TT support
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Publish to topic
\item Subscribe\textbackslash{}unsubscribe to topics
\item Support for C2D (cloud-\/to-\/device) topic based properties
\item Receiver events per subscription (subscriptions can share a receiver function or have distinct receiver functions)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Multiple fixes

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item T\+C\+P/\+U\+DP large packets (60 $<$ packets $<$=1460 bytes), M\+Q\+T\+T(s) functional, Geo-\/\+Fence support
\item Improved performance in interrupt servicing
\item Some memory optimizations
\item Background tasks alignment for R\+T\+OS and Arduino Scheduler compatibility
\item Added Geo-\/\+Fence support
\item F\+O\+TA partial support for D\+F\+O\+TA via H\+T\+T\+PS (file system F\+O\+TA is a roadmap feature )
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_version-history_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{v0.\+1 -\/ Initial publish}\label{md_version-history_autotoc_md12}
First release of a functional L\+T\+Em1 driver. Supported sockets (T\+CP\textbackslash{}\+U\+DP\textbackslash{}\+S\+SL) and limited M\+Q\+TT.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pure C99
\item Hardware/platform abstraction. Tested on S\+A\+M\+D21 and Arduino foundation but adaptable to R\+T\+OS
\item Abstraction of AT commands workflow, simple methods allow for invoke and await pattern
\item Minimal copy design
\item Network (cellular) connectivity, G\+N\+SS, and AT command support
\item Initial T\+C\+P/\+U\+DP send/recv (very small packets)
\item G\+N\+SS (G\+PS) support
\item Tests (VS Code Arduino) for above
\item Central I\+OP (input\textbackslash{}output processor) to handle B\+Gx communications and buffer management
\item Implements T\+CP\textbackslash{}\+U\+DP\textbackslash{}\+S\+SL clients using a Sockets pattern with receiver events
\item Started M\+Q\+TT support
