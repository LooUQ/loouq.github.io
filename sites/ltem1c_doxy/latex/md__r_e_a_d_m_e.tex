Loo\+UQ Circuit River L\+T\+Em1 modem driver implemented in C99 for portability and a small footprint.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\#\# Pre-\/\+Release -\/ v0.\+3 (release candidate)}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
The Loo\+UQ L\+T\+Em1c driver supports the Loo\+UQ Circuit River L\+T\+Em1 L\+TE modem. The L\+T\+Em1 is designed to allow for cost-\/effective cellular communications in embedded systems by supporting L\+TE C\+A\+T-\/\+M1 and L\+TE C\+A\+T-\/\+N\+B1 (N\+B-\/\+I\+OT) communications. The L\+T\+Em1 is certified for use on the Verizon network and a registered device for the T-\/\+Mobile (formerly Sprint) Curiosity Network. It is also fully tested and supported using Hologram S\+I\+Ms.

All of the core (blue) subsystems are functional. Extension subsystems (copper, with wide-\/borders) are optional and can be built into the application, or omitted to reduced code size. Grey boxes indicate future feature areas.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{Getting Started}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
{\itshape 1st off, thanks for taking a look at the L\+T\+Em1 hardware and L\+T\+Em1c software!}

The best way to get started understanding L\+T\+Em1c and considering it for your projects {\itshape today} is to look at the tests folder in the repository. This will be supplemented in the coming weeks. Working on getting doxygen documentation available soon and some real world example projects. The tests folder contains a series of progressive L\+T\+Em1c tests. Starting with simple platform I/O verification, thru M\+Q\+TT protocol support. Each test builds on a succesful previous level test.

Each test shows the process for initializing, starting services, and a loop exercising the functionality of the subsystem under test.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{L\+T\+Em1 Subsystems}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}

{\itshape action\+\_\+}  &Handles invoking AT commands to the modem\textquotesingle{}s module and handling response parsing. Supports variable command timeouts, thread safety and completion determination. Results are presented in a simple S\+T\+R\+U\+CT with a H\+T\+TP type status code, along with the detail string response   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mdminfo\+\_\+}  &Provides several common service functions for understanding the state of the modem and the network connection   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape gnss\+\_\+}  &The L\+T\+Em1 has a multi-\/constellation G\+N\+SS receiver (aka G\+PS is the US). The G\+N\+SS module provides support for accessing this functionality, like knowing exactly where your device is.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape geo\+\_\+}  &The L\+T\+Em1 supports the creation of geo-\/fence outlines and monitoring of device positioning relative to the geo-\/fence boundary. Note\+: geo\+\_\+ requires the gnss\+\_\+ module be built into your project to use these functions.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape sockets\+\_\+}  &This is the typical P\+O\+S\+IX style sockets layer. Support if T\+CP\textbackslash{}\+U\+DP\textbackslash{}\+S\+SL clients are there. {\itshape Note\+:} server mode is not currently planned, all US networks I have worked with do not support incoming connections for cellular without add-\/on services like V\+P\+Ns or other network constructs. I recommend alternatives to attempting direct connection to your device over cellular.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape mqtt\+\_\+}  &Support for M\+Q\+TT client functionality is built here. Attach, connect, subscribe, unsubscribe and publish all are supported. Limited testing so far on Q\+OS levels and advance features like clean and will. The M\+Q\+TT module supports message properties appended to the topic and has a property parser available.   \\\cline{1-2}
{\itshape iop\+\_\+}  &Generally you won\textquotesingle{}t directly interact with the iop\+\_\+ subsystem. It performs the buffer management to/from hardware. It interfaces with the action\+\_\+, sockets\+\_\+, and mqtt\+\_\+ subsystems to perform the necessary transfers.   \\\cline{1-2}
